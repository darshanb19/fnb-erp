# Project: F&B ERP

A multi-location Food & Beverage Enterprise Resource Planning system.
Solo developer, AI-assisted, sprint-based, epic-sequential.

## Read first, every session
- `_planning/02-master-spec.md` — single source of truth for scope, decisions, rules
- `_planning/03-prd.md` — functional requirements (FR1–FR119)
- `_planning/01-brainstorming-summary.md` — context and rationale
- `_planning/04-b2b-challan-spec.md` — supplementary spec for B2B dispatch
- `decision-log.md` — micro-decisions accumulated during build (created when first decision is made)
- `codebase-inventory.md` — map of project structure (created after Epic 1)

## Critical rules
- TypeScript strict mode, zero `any` types
- Every org-scoped query includes `brand_id` filter
- Use Drizzle ORM, no raw SQL
- Reference `DESIGN.md` tokens, never hardcode hex/spacing
- Route approvals through the Unified Approval Engine (Epic 3), not per-module
- Route notifications through the Notification Center (Epic 3), not per-module
- Always call `inventoryService.checkEnablement()` before any stock movement
- If instructions are vague or ambiguous, push back and ask before coding

## Context management
- Monitor with `/context` during long story implementations
- If approaching 60–70% context usage, STOP — story is too big. Commit progress, start fresh chat, or split the story.
- Do NOT use `/compact` during story implementation — it loses nuance
- High context usage is a story-sizing problem, not a context-management problem

## Methodology — Superpowers plugin

This project uses the official Superpowers plugin (https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers).
Anyone working on this repo needs it installed: in Claude Code, run `/plugin`, find Superpowers, install.

Apply skills per phase:

- **New epic kickoff** → `/brainstorming` then writing-plans
- **Story implementation** → execute-plan + test-driven-development + verification-before-completion
- **Stuck on a bug ≥ 15 minutes** → systematic-debugging
- **Before opening PR** → requesting-code-review then finishing-a-development-branch
- **Parallel work across modules** → subagent-driven-development + dispatching-parallel-agents

The phase ordering and rules in `_planning/02-master-spec.md` are canonical.
Superpowers methodology layers on top — it doesn't replace the phases.

## Current phase
**Phase 2a — PRD review.** No implementation yet. Architecture document (`_planning/architecture.md`) and the 9 open questions in master-spec §11 must be resolved before any epic implementation begins.
